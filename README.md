This repository provides demo servers and a benchmarking [script](https://github.com/ejoreo/nodejs-framework-perf/shellscript.sh) for testing Express, Koa, hapi, restify, and Fastify demo server performances.

A demo server and benchmarking script for Loopback can be found [here](https://github.com/ejoreo/loopback-perf).

I used [Apache Bench](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/apache_bench/index.htm) for benchmarking.
